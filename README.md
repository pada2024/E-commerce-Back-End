## Challenges

I'm actually proud of myself because despite receiving assistance I was on the right track and did not need to much help. There were little typos that I found could be a pain when not caught. I learned alot from this assignment and have a better understanding of how the backend operates but of course I will get better with time and more practice. One thing for me is when there is a lot of code it can be really overwhelming. I did stick with one route to get it working before I moved on, whereas before I would try to set everything up as once and that made a difference for me.
